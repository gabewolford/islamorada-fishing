Prior to moving to the Keys, I fished out of Bahia Pez Vela Lodge in Costa Rica immediately out of high school and rapidly became known as an innovator in saltwater fishing. Once in the Keys, I learned from some of the best in the business including legendary captains like Allan Starr, Don Gurgulio, Sarge Warner, Cecil Keith, and Jimmy Albright. Harold Adler, my father, was also a major mentor in my fishing career. It wasnâ€™t long after my move to the Keys that I began an impressive series of tournament wins, including winning the 1981 Bimini Blue Marlin Tournament, and twice winning the Cat Cay Tuna Tournament. I have won countless tournaments in the Florida Keys, including the Florida Keys Triple Crown Series and the Florida Keys Gold Cup events, yet I am also an expert at all aspects of Keys fishing, including dolphinfish and reef fishing. Recently I has been selected as a recipient of the IGFA Tommy Gifford.",
